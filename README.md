# Simple Mistral.ai Demo

This Python app implements a simple chatbot using Mistral's hosted models.

Mistral obviously also allows you to download their models and run them locally.
This is not intended for that.

You will need an API key from Mistral to run the demo.  You can
get one [here](https://mistral.ai/).
